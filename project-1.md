## Overview

In this project, you will need to implement a simple client-server application that transfers a file over a TCP connection.

All implementations should be written in C++ using [BSD sockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets).
**No high-level network-layer abstractions (like Boost.Asio or similar) are allowed in this project.**
You are allowed to use some high-level abstractions, including C++11 extensions, for parts that are not directly related to networking, such as string parsing, multi-threading.
We will also accept implementations written in C, however use of C++ is preferred.

The objective of this project is to learn basic operations of BSD sockets, understand implications of using the API, as well as to discover common pitfalls when working with network operations.

You are required to use `git` to track the progress of your work. **The project can receive a full grade only if the submission includes git history no shorter than 3 commits.**

You are encouraged to host your code in private repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or other places.  At the same time, you are PROHIBITED to make your code for the class project public during the class or any time after the class.  If you do so, you will be violating academic honestly policy that you have signed, as well as the student code of conduct and be subject to serious sanctions.

## Task Description

The project contains two parts: a server and a client.

- The server listens for TCP connections and saves all the received data from the client in a file.
- The client connects to the server and as soon as connection established, sends the content of a file to the server.

### Server Application Specification

The server application MUST be compiled into `server` binary, accepting two command-line arguments:

    $ server <PORT> <FILE-DIR>

- `<PORT>`: port number on which server will listen on connections.  The server must accept connections coming from any interface.
- `<FILE-DIR>`: directory name where to save the received files.

For example, the command below should start the server listening on port `5000` and saving received files in the directory `/save`.

    $ ./server 5000 /save

**Requirements**:

- The server must open a listening socket on the specified port number

- The server should gracefully process incorrect port number and exit with a non-zero error code (you can assume that the folder is always correct).  In addition to exit, the server must print out on standard error (`std::cerr`) an error message that starts with `ERROR:` string.

- The server should exit with code zero when receiving `SIGQUIT`/`SIGTERM` signal

- The server should be able to accept and process multiple connection from clients at the same time

- The server must count all established connections (1 for the first connect, 2 for the second, etc.).  The received file over the connection must be saved to `<FILE-DIR>/<CONNECTION-ID>.file` file  (e.g., `/save/1.file`, `/save/2.file`, etc.).  If the client doesn't send any data during gracefully terminated TCP connection, the server should create an empty file with the name that corresponds to the connection number.

- The server must assume error if no data received from the client for over `10 seconds`.  It should abort the connection and write a single `ERROR` string (without end-of-line/carret-return symbol) into the corresponding file.  Note that any partial input must be discarded.

- The server should be able to accept and save files up to `100 MiB`

### Client Application Specification

The client application MUST be compiled into `client` binary, accepting three command-line arguments:

    $ ./client <HOSTNAME-OR-IP> <PORT> <FILENAME>

- `<HOSTNAME-OR-IP>`: hostname or IP address of the server to connect
- `<PORT>`: port number of the server to connect
- `<FILENAME>`: name of the file to transfer to the server after the connection is established.

For example, the command below should result in connection to a server on the same machine listening on port 5000 and transfer content of `file.txt`:

    $ ./client localhost 5000 file.txt

**Requirements**:

- The client must be able to connect to the specified server and port, transfer the specified file, and gracefully terminate the connection.

- The client should gracefully process incorrect hostname and port number and exist with a non-zero exit code (you can assume that the specified file is always correct).  In addition to exit, the server must print out on standard error (`std::cerr`) an error message that starts with `ERROR:` string.

- Client application should exit with code zero after successful transfer of the file to server.  It should support transfer of files that are up to 100 MiB file.

- Client should handle connection and transmission errors.  The reaction to network or server errors should be **no longer that 10 seconds**:

    * Timeout to connect to server should be no longer than `10 seconds`
    * Timeout for not being able to send more data to server (not being able to write to send buffer) should be no longer than `10 seconds`.

    Whenever timeout occurs, the client should abort the connection, print an error string starting with `ERROR:` to standard error (`std::cerr`), and exit with non-zero code.

## A Few Hints

General hints:

*  If you are running the client and the server on the same machine, you can use "localhost" (without quotes) or "127.0.0.1" (without quotes) as the name of the server.

*  You should NOT use port numbers in the range of 0-1023 (these are reserved ports).  Test your client/server code by running as non-privileged user.  This will allow you to capture reserved port restrictions from the kernel.

Here are some hints of using multi-thread techniques to implement the server.

*  For the server, you may have the main thread listening (and accepting) incoming **connection requests**.
   * Any special socket API you need here?
   * How to keep the listening socket receiving new requests?

*  Once you accept a new connection, create a child thread for the new connection.
   * Is the new connection using the same socket as the one used by the main thread?

Here are some sample codes:

* A simple server that echoes back anything sent by the client: [server.cpp]({{ site.baseurl }}/hints/server.cpp), [client.cpp]({{ site.baseurl }}/hints/client.cpp)

* A simple multi-thread countdown: [multi-thread.cpp]({{ site.baseurl }}/hints/multi-thread.cpp)

## Environment Setup

The best way to guarantee full credit for the project is to do project development using a Ubuntu 16.04-based virtual machine.

You can easily create an image in your favourite virtualization engine (VirtualBox, VMware) using the Vagrant platform and steps outlined below.

### Set Up Vagrant and Create VM Instance

**Note that all example commands are executed on the host machine (your laptop), e.g., in `Terminal.app` (or `iTerm2.app`) on macOS, `cmd` in Windows, and `console` or `xterm` on Linux.  After the last step (`vagrant ssh`) you will get inside the virtual machine and can compile your code there.**

- Download and install your favourite virtualization engine, e.g., [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

- Download and install [Vagrant tools](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) for your platform

- Set up project and VM instance

  * Clone project template

        git clone https://github.com/cs118/spring17-project1 ~/cs118-proj1
        cd ~/cs118-proj1

  * Initialize VM

        vagrant up

    Do not start VM instance manually from VirtualBox GUI, otherwise you may have various problems (connection error, connection timeout, missing packages, etc.)
    {: class="alert alert-warning"}

  * To establish an SSH session to the created VM, run

        vagrant ssh

  If you are using Putty on Windows platform, `vagrant ssh` will return information regarding the IP address and the port to connect to your virtual machine.

- Work on your project

  All files in `~/cs118-proj1` folder on the host machine will be automatically synchronized with `/vagrant` folder on the virtual machine.  For example, to compile your code, you can run the following commands:

        vagrant ssh
        cd /vagrant
        make

### Notes

* If you want to open another SSH session, just open another terminal and run `vagrant ssh` (or create a new Putty session).

* If you are using Windows, read [this article](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vagrant-windows/) to help yourself set up the environment.

* The code base contains the basic `Makefile` and two empty files `server.cpp` and `client.cpp`.

        $ vagrant ssh
        vagrant@vagrant:~$ cd /vagrant
        vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ ls -a
        .  ..  client  client.cpp  .git  .gitignore  Makefile  README.md  server  server.cpp  .vagrant  Vagrantfile

* You are now free to add more files and modify the Makefile to make the `server` and `client` full-fledged implementation.

## Submission Requirements

To submit your project, you need to prepare:

1. A `README.md` file placed in your code that includes:

    * Your name, UCLA ID
    * The high level design of your server and client
    * The problems your ran into and how you solved the problems
    * List of any additional libraries used
    * Acknowledgement of any online tutorials or code example (except class website) you have been using.

    **If you need additional dependencies for your project, you must update Vagrant file.**

1. All your source code, `Makefile`, `README.md`, `Vagrantfile`, and `.git` folder with your git repository history as a `.tar.gz` archive.

    To create the submission, **use the provided Makefile** in the skeleton project.  Just update `Makefile` to include your UCLA ID and then just type

        make tarball

    Then submit the resulting archive to Gradescope.

Before submission, please make sure:

1. Your code compiles
2. Client and server conforms to the specification
3. `.tar.gz` archive does not contain temporary or other unnecessary files.  We will automatically deduct points otherwise.

Submissions that do not follow these requirements will not get any credit.

## Grading

Your code will be first checked by a software plagiarism detecting tool. If we find any plagiarism, you will not get any credit.

Your code will then be automatically tested in some testing scenarios.

We will test your server against a "standard" implementation of the client, your client against a "standard" server, as well as your client against your server.  Projects receive full credit only all these checks are passed.
